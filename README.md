# Warehouse Management System

This project is conducted for module COMP2008J-Software EngProject1(B), whose basic aim is to construct a complete Warehouse Management System that meets the user needs.

-  Security System 
It contains login/out and corresponding records. 
Managers can check who has done operations and when. Workers can perform basic operations.
Managers have accessibilities to Warehouse Products list, Financial statistics, Communication platform and Visualization.

-  Products Inventory list
This is a table containing all the products in the current repository. Where manager can do add, delete, search and modify operations to the commodities. Workers only have the authorization to view the commodities.

-  Financial statistics
This is a visualization for the cost/budget ratio, where the manager can set a budget over a period of time (unit of quarters) or over categories. And the graphs will generate, presenting ratio in the yaxis, variable in the xaxis

-  Communication
This systsem is designed differently for the uses of managers and workers. Where Managers are able to select commodities he wants to alter, enter the amounts he wants to alter, and give a specific operation (e.g. stock-in), which leads to a certain city and be assigned to a worker for getting the job done. The loop will only terminate when the worker has confirmed in his notification center that the request is completed.

-  Visualisation
This page shows the locations of repositories on the map, manager can switch repositories easily by clicking on a certain location. We also included a relation chart, so that if further categories are added, this can grow and show a clear relation between them. Also on the bottom right of the page, a warehouse utilazation is displayed, to show how much of the corresponding warehose is left.
